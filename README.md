# To-Do-List
A To Do List that works like the notes app on an Iphone or Mac. 

UPDATED
Making it work like the notes app on an apple device was a tall task to attack. I'm starting small. A to do list where you manually add the task with a button, rather than the app doing it for you.
Not a fan of it, but I want to work my way up to the previous version. It is better than having to manually add a task with a button.

Previously was only doing front end development, but now I am cutting down on the U.I on the app and going to practice the backend side of things. Going to use Node and Express for the backend and maybe a front end framework like Bootstrap
for a decent U.I. Also going to work on my commiting skills because I've been doing it wrong this whole time kind.
